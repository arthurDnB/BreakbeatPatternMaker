# Development Log & AI Handover Guide

This document maintains the running project state and change log so that multiple AI assistants (e.g., Antigravity, OpenAI Codex) and human developers can seamlessly collaborate without losing context or introducing conflicts.

## 🤖 Rules for AI Assistants Working on this Repo

1. **Check for latest changes before editing:**
   * Always check `git status` and pull if connected to remote:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```
2. **Execution on Windows:**
   * PowerShell execution policy may block `npm.ps1`. Always use `npm.cmd` directly for commands (e.g. `npm.cmd test`, `npm.cmd run build:site`).
3. **Verify tests before committing:**
   * Unit test suite (52 tests): `npm.cmd test`
   * Site deployment build & Playwright smoke test: `npm.cmd run test:site`
4. **Update this log:**
   * Document each change under the [Change Log](#change-log) section with date, summary of files modified, and rationale.
5. **Git commit and push:**
   * Commit with a descriptive message. Pushing to `main` automatically triggers GitHub Pages deployment via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Next Tasks (from `PROJECT-SCOPE.md` & `UI-UX-REDESIGN-PLAN.md`)

* [x] **Phase 1 (Complete):** Tracker-first workspace layout, sticky transport, contextual inspector, pattern bank tabs.
* [x] **Phase 2 (Complete):** Editing clarity, pending draft state, pitch slider gesture undo grouping, hit articulation (ratchets & gates).
* [x] **Phase 3 (Complete):** Simplified sound selection, 32 CC0 bundled sample catalog, compact routing/effects indicators.
* [ ] **Phase 4 (Next Priority):** 
  - Unified song arrangement & export presentation.
  - Make transport explicitly aware of playback target (Pattern vs. Song).
  - Explicit song tempo with backward-compatible project migration.
* [ ] **Future Audio Roadmaps:** MP3 export, velocity-layered drum kits, sample-browser filtering.
* [ ] *Note: Renoise integration has been retired in favor of the standalone in-browser instrument.*
